# Founder OS

**The autonomous operating system for founders.**

Running a company solo means fighting fragmentation. Slack knows the conversation, GitHub knows the code, Stripe knows the revenue, Obsidian/Notion know the docs, Calendar knows the schedule — but **nothing knows the company**. So you app-switch all day, reassembling context by hand.

Founder OS sits *above* the tools you already use. Its core is the **Company State Engine** — a canonical, living model of your company (goals, projects, tasks, decisions, metrics, people, meetings) that **passively observes** your tools and **surfaces the unified picture where you already work** (Obsidian first, Notion next). It runs five loops — **Observe → Remember → Understand → Execute → Learn** — coordinating specialist AI agents to do the heavy lifting in the background.

It talks to itself, generates the right workflow for any request on the fly (no drag-and-drop, no manual automation), and keeps a single source of truth so you stop switching between apps and channels.

Built for solo founders and tiny teams who need the output of a 10-person ops team but can't afford one.

## The Problem

Running a startup solo means you're the CEO, marketer, researcher, PM, support rep, and ops manager — all at once. You context-switch dozens of times a day. Important things fall through cracks. You spend more time *managing* work than *doing* work.

Existing AI tools help with isolated tasks (write a blog post, summarise a doc), but they don't understand your business holistically. They don't remember what you told them last week. They can't coordinate across domains. They're co-pilots — not co-founders.

And workflow tools like n8n, Zapier, or Make? They require *you* to design every automation by hand. You have to know what to automate, wire up every trigger and step, and rebuild flows as your company changes. That's more busywork, not less.

## The Vision

Founder OS is not a chatbot. It's an **operating system** for your startup — a persistent, memory-rich, multi-agent system that:

- **The Company State Engine (the moat)** — a canonical, living model of your company: goals, projects, tasks, decisions, metrics, people, meetings. Every tool you use becomes a *synchronization endpoint*; the engine reconciles them into one source of truth and syncs it back to where you work (Obsidian first, Notion next). No more app-switching to figure out *what's actually going on*.
- **Five loops of autonomy** — like an OS daemon, it runs continuously: **Observe** (passively monitor your tools) → **Remember** (ingest into the State Engine + memory) → **Understand** (score state against your goals) → **Execute** (generate workflows and act) → **Learn** (compile reusable skills, prune what's stale).
- **Fed three ways, kept clean** — the engine updates from your tools (`observed`), the docs you hand it (`user_doc`), and what it learns itself (`system`: agent memories + Hermes-style skills). A built-in **hygiene system** (write-gate, dedup, decay, Curator) keeps it genuinely useful and never bloated.
- **One entry point, zero routing** — you talk to the **Orchestrator** (inspired by [Stripe's Minions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15678)). It analyses your request, decomposes it into subtasks, delegates to the right specialist agents, and synthesises one coherent answer. You never pick an agent.
- **Auto-generated workflows** — no drag-and-drop, no manual automation. The Orchestrator creates **custom multi-agent workflows on the fly** (dynamic in-process AOV graphs) based on what your company actually needs. *(Self-hosted n8n is an optional, invisible execution backend if you want a visible/editable flow — not the differentiator.)*
- **Delegates internally** — agents talk to each other (Agent-to-Agent protocol) without you orchestrating every step. Ask for a product launch plan and the Orchestrator coordinates Research, Content, Product, and Ops agents behind the scenes
- **Remembers everything** — 4-layer agent memory + temporal knowledge graph with composite scoring, spaced-repetition review, entity linking, and typed relationships
- **Plans your week** — automated weekly planner with Google Calendar integration, ICE-scored priorities, and Monday-morning auto-generation via APScheduler
- **Human-in-the-loop** — approval system with 3-tier risk classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH), per-user preferences, and mandatory gating for irreversible actions
- **Uses your tools** — MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets agents connect to external tool servers (GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear, analytics platforms) as first-class capabilities
- **Runs in the background** — Celery task queue for long-running orchestrations with status polling, cancellation, and per-user task history
- **Scales with you** — Day 1 you're a solo founder and the system runs simple single-agent tasks. Month 6 you have a team, 10 integrations, and complex cross-functional processes — the same system handles it, automatically composing more sophisticated agent workflows as your context grows
- **Runs on your terms** — OSS-first, local-first. Default LLM is Ollama (free, runs on your machine). Swap to Anthropic, Gemini, or any OpenAI-compatible API when you need more power. No vendor lock-in.

The end state: you wake up, open Founder OS, and your AI team has already triaged support tickets, drafted this week's newsletter, flagged a competitor move, updated the roadmap, and prepared a prioritised task list for your day. No workflow was manually configured — the system figured out what to do based on your goals, data, and history.

### How Auto-Workflows Work (vs. n8n / Zapier / Make)

Traditional workflow tools require you to **design every automation by hand**:

| | n8n / Zapier / Make | Founder OS |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow creation | Manual drag-and-drop | **Auto-generated by the Orchestrator** |
| Knows your business | No | Yes — pgvector knowledge base + metrics + history |
| Adapts as you grow | You rebuild flows | **Workflows evolve automatically** |
| Cross-domain coordination | You wire each connection | **Agents coordinate via A2A protocol** |
| Requires expertise | Yes — you design the logic | **Just describe what you need** |

When you say *"prepare for our Series A"*, the Orchestrator doesn't look up a pre-built workflow. It **creates one on the fly**:

1. Delegates to **Research Agent** → competitor landscape, market sizing
2. Delegates to **Product Agent** → traction metrics, roadmap summary
3. Delegates to **Content Agent** → pitch deck narrative, investor FAQ
4. Delegates to **Ops Agent** → due diligence checklist, data room prep
5. **Synthesises** everything into a cohesive action plan

Next month, when you say the same thing, the workflow will be **different** — because your metrics changed, you have new integrations, and the agents have learned from your feedback. No manual rewiring needed.

### Core Design Principles

1. **No frameworks** — No LangChain, no CrewAI, no LlamaIndex. Every component (BaseAgent, ToolRegistry, Router, ExecutionEngine, Memory) is built from scratch. We use direct SDK calls and raw async Python. This means we understand every line, can debug anything, and aren't locked into someone else's abstractions.

2. **OSS-first** — Default LLM is Ollama running locally (free). PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI — all open source. You can run the entire system on a laptop with zero API costs.

3. **Backend-native** — This is a real backend system, not a notebook experiment. Async everywhere, proper database schema with migrations, JWT auth, structured API routes, Docker infrastructure.

4. **Composition over inheritance** — Agents are assembled from independent components (LLM + Tools + Memory + Router + EventBus) via the registry. Swap any piece without touching the others.

---

## What's Built

### Infrastructure
- **FastAPI** async API with lifespan management — **64 endpoints** across 9 route groups
- **PostgreSQL 16 + pgvector** — 24-table core schema + 4 planner/memory tables (28 total), 3 views, 30+ indexes, seed data for agents, workflows, and subscription plans
- **Redis 7** — caching, working memory, shared memory, pub/sub event bus, approval queue, Celery broker
- **Alembic** migrations
- **Clerk JWT auth** (RS256 / JWKS verification)
- **Docker Compose** — PostgreSQL (pgvector/pgvector:pg16) + Redis (redis:7-alpine) with health checks and named volumes
- **Celery task queue** — Redis-backed async worker with 3 queues (default, agents, orchestrator), 5-minute soft timeout, auto-retry, JSON serialization
- **APScheduler** — cron-based background scheduler for automated weekly plan generation (Monday 08:00 IST)

### Agent System
- **Orchestrator** — top-level manager agent (Stripe Minions pattern). Analyses any request, decomposes into subtasks, delegates to specialists via `delegate_task` tool, synthesises the response. The LLM decides the workflow — no hardcoded routing
- **BaseAgent** — composable agent core with system prompts, tool use loops, memory, delegation, and event emission
- **7 Agents** — Orchestrator + 6 Specialists (Planner, Content, Research, Ops, Product, Support) — each with distinct capabilities, tools, and system prompts
- **Agents-as-tools** — specialist agents are exposed to the Orchestrator as callable tools. The `delegate_task` tool is bound at runtime via closure injection — the Orchestrator's LLM sees it as a regular tool, but it spawns a full agent under the hood
- **LLM Provider abstraction** — 6 provider classes, 4 selectable via factory:
  - *Ollama* — free/local, no API key required
  - *Anthropic* — Claude (official SDK, full tool-use support)
  - *OpenAI-compatible* — vLLM, Together AI, Groq, LM Studio, LocalAI
  - *Gemini* — OpenAI-compatible endpoint + native REST API + **3-tier fallback** (Gemini OpenAI-compat → Gemini Native REST → OpenAI) for maximum reliability
- **Tool Protocol (MCP-compatible)** — `ToolProvider` interface, `LocalToolProvider` for built-in tools, `ToolRegistry` for multi-provider aggregation, parallel tool execution, runtime closure overrides
- **MCP Adapter** — stdio and SSE transport clients for connecting to external MCP tool servers (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- **A2A Router** — Agent-to-Agent capability-based routing and delegation. Agents declare capabilities via `AgentCard`; the router scores and dispatches tasks to the best-fit agent
- **Execution Engine** — step-based agentic loop with parallel tool calls, cost tracking, token accounting, and configurable max rounds
- **Event Bus** — Redis pub/sub for async inter-agent communication (agent.started, orchestration.started, delegation.requested, etc.)
- **12 Built-in Tools** — delegate_task, search_knowledge, web_search, get_business_metrics, create_task, list_tasks, update_task_status, save_draft, get_integrations, get_writing_style, get_current_datetime, store_working_memory

### Memory System (Dual Architecture)

**4-Layer Agent Memory** — composed via `AgentMemory`, assembled into context at runtime:

| Layer | Backend | Scope | TTL |
|-------|---------|-------|-----|
| Conversation | In-process (list) | Single agent run | Session (rolling 50 messages) |
| Working | Redis | Per-user, per-agent, per-session | 4 hours |
| Shared | Redis | Cross-agent scratch-pad | 8 hours |
| Long-term | PostgreSQL + pgvector | Per-user, permanent | ∞ (cosine similarity, min 0.70) |

**Temporal Knowledge Graph** — a second memory system (`memory_pages` + `memory_links`) with:
- **Composite scoring**: `(semantic_sim × w₁) + (temporal_relevance × w₂) + (importance × w₃) + (access_freq × w₄)`
- **Spaced-repetition review** — memories are surfaced for review on schedule, strengthening recall
- **Entity extraction** — memories tagged with entities (people, companies, tools) for entity-based search
- **Chapters** — memories are organized into named chapters for browsable context
- **Typed links** — relationships between memories: `related`, `caused_by`, `led_to`, `contradicts`, `updates`, `supersedes`, `part_of` (with strength 0–1)
- **Decay + pinning** — unpinned memories decay over time; pinned memories persist indefinitely

### Approval System (Human-in-the-Loop)

Every tool call flows through `ApprovalGate` before execution:

| Risk Level | Behavior | Examples |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **LOW** | Auto-approved by default | search, list, get operations |
| **MEDIUM** | Follows user preference | create_task, save_draft |
| **HIGH** | **Always requires explicit approval** — cannot be bypassed | git push, post tweet, send email, deploy, payments (30 high-risk tools mapped) |

Per-user preferences stored in Redis: `always_allow` / `always_deny` / `ask`. HIGH-risk tools cannot be set to `always_allow`. Pending approvals expire after 1 hour.

### Weekly Planner

Full weekly planning pipeline with Google Calendar integration:

- **Onboarding** — business profile intake (name, type, stage, industry, goals, team size)
- **Plan generation** — LLM-powered structured weekly plans with ICE scoring (Impact × Confidence × Ease), daily schedules, task assignments, delegations, risks, and success criteria
- **Google Calendar sync** — OAuth2 flow, token management, push plans as calendar events, CRUD individual events
- **ICS export** — download plans as `.ics` files
- **Automated scheduling** — APScheduler cron job generates plans every Monday at 08:00 AM IST for all connected users
- **Plan history** — all past plans stored with stats (task count, events created, duration)
- **Smart prompt endpoint** — natural language interface that understands intent, pulls memory, creates events, updates context, and/or replans the week

### Knowledge Base

Full knowledge ingestion and retrieval system:

- **Ingest** — plain text, URLs, structured JSON, or batch (up to 50 documents)
- **Search** — hybrid/semantic/fulltext search across the knowledge base
- **CRUD** — list, get, delete individual items or bulk delete by category
- **Stats** — knowledge base statistics including embedding coverage

### Background Queue

Celery-powered async execution:

- **Submit** — queue agent runs or orchestrations for background execution
- **Poll** — check task status and retrieve results
- **History** — list recent background tasks per user
- **Cancel** — cancel pending or running tasks
- **Config** — 3 dedicated queues, 5-min soft limit, 6-min hard kill, auto-retry with exponential backoff

## Where It's Going

### Near-term

- [ ] **Embedding pipeline** — auto-generate vector embeddings on knowledge ingestion (Ollama `nomic-embed-text` / OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`) so RAG activates at query time (knowledge ingestion and search endpoints are built; embedding generation needs wiring)
- [ ] **MCP server connections** — wire MCP adapter into config so agents can connect to GitHub, Slack, Linear, Notion tool servers out of the box (adapter is built; config-driven connection layer needed)
- [ ] **Workflow persistence** — save orchestrator-generated workflows as reusable templates; the system learns which patterns work for your company and reuses them
- [ ] **Real tool implementations** — replace placeholder/mock tools with actual DB queries, API calls, and integrations (knowledge search and task tools are wired; web_search, metrics, integrations still use mock data)
- [ ] **Streaming responses** — SSE streaming from agents to the frontend

### Mid-term

- [ ] **Web dashboard** (Next.js `web` app) — chat interface, task boards, knowledge base management, agent configuration, metrics dashboards
- [ ] **Integration connectors** — Stripe, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Linear, Google Analytics, Twitter/X, email (IMAP/SMTP) (Google Calendar is fully integrated)
- [ ] **Scheduled orchestrations** — configurable cron triggers beyond the Monday weekly plan ("every morning, Ops standup + metrics check") (APScheduler is in place; needs UI-driven schedule management)
- [ ] **Workflow evolution** — as new integrations and data sources connect, the orchestrator automatically incorporates them into workflows without reconfiguration
- [ ] **Learning loop** — agents improve from feedback; `TaskFeedback` and `LearningInsight` tables are ready. Workflows that produce good results get reinforced; poor ones get adapted
- [ ] **Multi-user / team support** — role-based access, shared workspaces, per-team agent configurations

### Long-term Vision

- [ ] **Fully autonomous operations** — agents trigger each other without human input. A support ticket → Support Agent responds → Product Agent logs a bug → Ops Agent updates the sprint → Content Agent drafts a changelog. All auto-orchestrated.
- [ ] **Company-aware workflow generation** — the system uses your business stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A, growth), team size, industry, and integrations to generate completely different workflow strategies. A 2-person SaaS startup gets different automation than a 20-person e-commerce company.
- [ ] **Voice interface** — talk to Founder OS like a co-founder
- [ ] **Mobile app** — Founder OS in your pocket, push notifications for critical alerts
- [ ] **Marketplace** — community-built agents, tools, and workflow templates
- [ ] **Self-improving system** — agents analyse their own performance, identify failure modes, and refine prompts + workflows automatically

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d   # PostgreSQL + Redis

# 2. Set up the API
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure
cp .env.example .env   # Edit with your settings
# Default LLM is Ollama — install it: https://ollama.com
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# 4. Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 5. Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# 6. (Optional) Start Celery worker for background tasks
celery -A app.celery_app worker --loglevel=info -Q default,agents,orchestrator

# 7. Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# 8. Talk to the Orchestrator
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/agents/orchestrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Plan my week — I need to ship v2.0, write a blog post, and prep for investor calls"}'
```

### Google Calendar Setup (Optional)

To enable weekly plan → Google Calendar sync:

1. Create a Google Cloud project with Calendar API enabled
2. Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`
3. Connect via `POST /api/planner/connect` (OAuth2 flow)
4. Plans will auto-sync every Monday at 08:00 AM IST

## Philosophy

> "The best startup tool is one that does the work, not one that helps you do the work."

Founder OS exists because we believe:

1. **AI agents should be systems, not features.** Not a chat widget bolted onto a dashboard — a persistent, intelligent backend that operates your business around the clock.
2. **Workflows should generate themselves.** If you have to design an automation by hand, the tool has already failed. The system should observe your business, understand what needs doing, and compose the right agent workflow automatically.
3. **Automation should scale with you.** Day 1: simple single-agent tasks. Month 6: complex cross-functional orchestrations. The system grows because it learns — not because you wired up more nodes in a graph editor.

Every design decision flows from one question: *what would a tireless, infinitely patient, always-available co-founder do?*
